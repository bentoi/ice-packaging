Description: Ice (Internet Communications Engine)
 Ice is a modern object-oriented toolkit that enables you to build
 distributed applications with minimal effort. Ice allows you to focus
 your efforts on your application logic while it takes care of all
 interactions with low-level network programming interfaces. With Ice,
 there is no need to worry about details such as opening network
 connections, serializing and deserializing data for network
 transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts (to name but a
 few of dozens of such low-level details).
