# Building Linux RPM Packages

This README describes how to create source and binary RPM packages for Ice
as a regular (non-root) user on your Linux system.

## The .rpmmacros File

Create a file named `.rpmmacros` in your home directory similar to the following:
```
    %_signature gpg
    %_gpg_path /home/user/.gnupg
    %_gpg_name XYZ Inc. (release key) <support@xyz.com>
    %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg
    %dist .el7
```

The GPG settings are only needed if you want to sign your RPMs. Replace
`/home/user` with a path name that is appropriate for your system.

The value for `%dist` should be one of
```
    .sles12
    .el7
    .amzn1
```

These tags correspond to the Linux RPM distributions provided by ZeroC.

Optional macros can be set to customize the RPMs:

* `nameprefix` : defines the prefix to use for RPM package names. For example,
if it's defined to `zeroc-`, the RPM for glacier2 will be named `zeroc-glacier2`
and the RPM for `libice3.7-c++` will be named `libzeroc-ice3.7-c++`.

* `ice_license` : defines the license shown in the RPM information (default
value is `GPLv2 with exceptions`).

## The RPM package build directory

The RPM package build directory is usually `~/rpmbuild`.

## RPM build prerequisites

First install ZeroC's key to avoid warnings with unsigned packages:
```
    $ wget https://zeroc.com/download/GPG-KEY-zeroc-release
    $ sudo rpm --import GPG-KEY-zeroc-release
```

Then add the Ice repository for your system and install the source RPM:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7:
```
     $ cd /etc/yum.repos.d
     $ sudo wget https://zeroc.com/download/rpm/zeroc-ice-el7.repo
```

* Amazon Linux:
```
     $ cd /etc/yum.repos.d
     $ sudo wget https://zeroc.com/download/rpm/zeroc-ice-amzn1.repo
```

* Suse Linux Enterprise Server 12:
```
     $ wget https://zeroc.com/download/rpm/zeroc-ice-sles12.repo
     $ sudo zypper addrepo zeroc-ice-sles12.repo
```

Now download and install the source rpm:
```
     $ yumdownloader --source ice
     $ rpm -i ice-3.7.0-1.el7.src.rpm
```

You can find the `ice.spec` file in the `~/rpmbuild/SPECS` directory, while the archive
files are in the `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES` directory.

The `ice.spec` file defines a number of build requirements that must be installed on
your system in order to build the RPM packages.

## Creating the source RPM package

Follow these steps to (re-)create the Ice source RPM:

1. Copy all desired source files and patches into the directory `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES`

2. Review `ice.spec` to ensure all necessary source files and patches are listed
   using `SourceX` and `PatchX` directives. The files listed here will be included
   in the source RPM.

3. Run rpmbuild:
```
      $ rpmbuild -bs --sign ice.spec
```

Omit the `--sign` option if you do not want to sign the source RPM, or if you do
not have a GnuPG key prepared.

The source RPM is created in `~rpmbuild/SRPMS`.

## Creating the binary RPM packages

To create binary RPM packages for Ice, you must first install the source RPM:
```
      $ rpm -i ice-3.7.0-1.src.rpm
```
If you have not already done so, install the RPM prerequisites listed in `ice.spec`.
The following additional steps are also necessary:

- Install the Java Development Kit version 1.8 and verify that the `javac `command
is present in your `PATH`.

- If you want to sign the IceGridGUI jar file, you should set these environment variables:
```
      JARSIGNER_KEYSTORE=<path to the keystore file with the certificate>
      JARSIGNER_KEYSTORE_ALIAS=<alias of the certificate>
      JARSIGNER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<keystore file password>
```
   If you don't set them, the jar file signing will be skipped.

- Build the RPMs as a non-root user.
```
      $ cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
      $ rpmbuild -bb ice.spec
```
Omit the `--sign` option if you do not want to sign the RPMs, or if you do not
have a GnuPG key setup.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, your can optionally cross-compile i686 RPMs on a x86_64 host:
```
      $ setarch i686 rpmbuild -bb ice.spec
```
Upon completion, all the binary RPMs can be found in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS`.
